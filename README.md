# CNN

This repo is based on an assignment in a machine learning course. In this assignment, students were required to train and tune a CNN model classifying 0-9 digits with a time limit of 45 minutes. The given dataset consists of 3000 training images and 500 test images in each class. Due to size limit in Github, the data.zip is uploaded to Google Drive at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dJCF4GMHpKcNxlh_lxfaaqZTUJ8HpK81/view?usp=sharing
